# Population genetics of three sea snake species using DaRT-seq

This repository contains the code used to process DaRT-seq data for three
sea snake species: *Aipysurus laevis*, *Hydrophis major* and *Hydrophis stokesii*.

## Repository layout

- **scripts**: This directory contains the processing scripts.
- **data**: Contains metadata files that are used in the analyses.
- **results**: All analysis results are stored in this directory.

Each results sub-directory has its own `README`, which acts as a summary of what
analyses were conducted and the final results. To use the `.Rmd` files, open
this directory as an R-rpoject first. All paths use the [here][here] package
to try and simplify file-paths.
